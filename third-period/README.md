# Third Period SQL Practice

This directory contains advanced SQL scripts, exercises, and workshops designed for the third period of database learning. The focus is on deepening your understanding of PostgreSQL through practical examples, cursor usage, and real-world scenarios.

## Folder Structure

- **clases/**
  - Contains class materials and example scripts. These files typically introduce new concepts or advanced SQL features, such as cursors, and provide illustrative code for classroom discussion.

- **exercises/**
  - Includes hands-on exercises for practicing the concepts covered in class. These scripts are meant to be completed by students to reinforce learning, often involving more complex queries or procedural logic.

- **workshop/**
  - Workshop folders contain project-based or thematic SQL challenges. For example, the `june_2` subfolder includes a hospital triggers project and its own README, guiding you through the implementation of advanced triggers and automation in PostgreSQL.

## How to Use

1. **Start with the `clases/` folder** to review the main concepts and see example code.
2. **Practice with the scripts in `exercises/`** to test your understanding and apply what you've learned.
3. **Tackle the `workshop/` projects** for a deeper, scenario-based challenge that simulates real-world database tasks.

All scripts are written for PostgreSQL and are intended for educational purposes. You are encouraged to modify, extend, and experiment with the code to enhance your learning experience.
